Enabling IIS to run with PHP is not a fun thing!

1) Enable IIS 
    - Windows Features in Win Search
    - IIS - check all + CGI from App Dev Features


2) Add PHP to IIS
    - https://www.iis.net/learn/application-frameworks/scenario-build-a-php-website-on-iis/configuring-step-1-install-iis-and-php#13
    - Use Web PI to install all the components

3) Follow tutorial to setup new App in IIS
    - modify Host file for DNS issues

4) Include FastCGI for PHP
    - Look at the link above
    - shouild enable CGI in IIS, check first point

5) If everything went well, phpinfo should work

6) To enable XDebug for VSCode
    - https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/nicktrog/2016/02/11/configuring-visual-studio-code-for-php-development/
    - Follow tutorial
    - Start server, setup breakpoint
    - Should work on default port, if it does not, test the 9000 port, or whatever is written in launch.json
    - if it's endlessly loading, enable firewall for port of debugger
    - typical indicator that the port is firewalled is "connection closed" message in debug console

7) Fun is not over
    - To enable PHP to connect to MSSQL DB, you need drivers
    - https://www.saotn.org/install-microsoft-sql-server-driver-php/
    - Official Microsoft site doesn't have the 7.1 at the moment, that's why the link
